## Overview

Welcome to the **LearnDockerLLM** repository. This collection features a series of progressively complex examples designed to demonstrate how to integrate [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/), Large Language Models (LLMs) from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), and Docker. The examples range from foundational setups using Docker Compose to advanced applications where users interact with LLMs via a web interface.

## Examples

The repository is organized into several directories, each housing a unique example:

1. **Simple**: Demonstrates using Docker Compose to orchestrate a Panel application backed by a PostgreSQL database, showcasing the integration of multiple services.
2. **SimpleChat**: Builds upon Simple to create a basic chat interface with an LLM powered by OpenAI.
3. **LlmConversation**: Loops two LLMs into a conversation with each other, demonstrating complex interaction patterns.
4. **LlmConsistency**: Examines how consistent the responses from an LLM are on math problems generated by another LLM.
5. **PanelCliExample**: Illustrates the foundational structure for connecting a Panel web interface to a secondary target container, allowing for control over SSH.
6. **LlmCliTool**: Provides the capability to use an SSH terminal from the web cooperatively with an LLM, enabling automated insights and command execution assistance in a collaborative environment.

Projects progress in complexity, starting from basic examples to sophisticated cooperative bash shells that integrate user input with OpenAI's LLM capabilities directly from a web browser.
